two test cases a and b

first is mkdocs 1.2

second is current HEAD

(exact version in use is shown in every test setup and run)

test plan:

  # [1] make test-a-setup
  # [2] ./test.bash
  # [3] make clean
  # [4] make test-b-setup
  # [5] ./test.bash

the example is as minimalistic as I could imagine:

    docs/README.md -> README.md

in case anything hangs there is

    make clean

that kills serving processes and removes files from disk.

to just create the file structure

    make docs

test runner is ./run.sh
